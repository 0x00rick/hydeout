  Hi and welcome to my blog.
</p>

I'm a student finishing up on his masters degree in computer science while trying to get his foot into the world of information security.

By chance I developed a major interest in exploitation, reverse engineering and hardware hacking.

This blog will present all my private investigations and findings.
I'm hoping to be able to share interesting information with anyone stumbling upon my blog.

I'm open for any inquiries and questions. Just hit me up on any of the official channels stated on the homepage.
